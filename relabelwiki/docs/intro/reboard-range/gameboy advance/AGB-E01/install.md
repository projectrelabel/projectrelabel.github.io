### Tools Required

  | Tools            | Description                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Soldering Iron            | For soldering components              |
| Flux                      | Helps with soldering and prevents bridges |
| Solder (.38 recommended)  | Best for small SMD work              |
| Hot Air Rework Station    | Optional, useful for component removal |
| Desolder Wick             | Used to remove solder from joints    |


## Installation Steps (Hot Air)

### 1. Remove the ROM IC:
- Using a hot air rework station, heat the IC pads on the original board evenly.
- Carefully lift the ROM IC from the board with tweezers once the solder has melted.

### 2. Prepare the New PCB:
- Apply flux to the IC pads on the new PCB.
- Lightly tin the pads with solder to prepare for IC placement.

### 3. Mount the IC:
- Position the ROM IC in the correct orientation on the new PCB. **(Double-check pin alignment!)**
- Heat the PCB evenly until the solder melts.
- Gently press the IC onto the pads with tweezers, ensuring all pins make contact.
- Remove heat and hold the IC in place until the solder solidifies.

### 4. Add Additional Components (if included):
- If your kit includes new capacitors or resistors, use hot air and tweezers to carefully place them onto the PCB.
- Otherwise, resolder the old components onto the new board.

### 5. Reshell and Test:
- Assemble the cartridge shell.
- Insert the game into your console and enjoy!




## Installation Steps (Soldering Iron)

### 1. Remove the ROM IC:
- Use a soldering iron and desoldering wick to carefully remove solder from the IC pads on the original board.
- Gently lift the ROM IC from the board. Take extra care with this method to avoid damaging the IC.

### 2. Prepare the New PCB:
- Apply flux to the IC pads on the new PCB.
- Position the ROM IC on the pads in the correct orientation. Apply gentle pressure to ensure alignment.

### 3. Secure the IC:
- Solder one corner pin of the IC to hold it in place, then solder the opposite corner.
- Remove pressure once the IC is secured.

### 4. Complete Soldering:
- Use drag soldering to solder the remaining pins to the PCB. Ensure no bridges are formed, and all connections are secure.

### 5. Add Additional Components (if included):
- If your kit includes new capacitors or resistors, solder them carefully onto the PCB.
- Otherwise, resolder the old components onto the new board.

### 6. Reshell and Test:
- Reassemble the cartridge shell.
- Test your game in the console and enjoy!
