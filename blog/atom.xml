<p>Ever wanted to learn soldering and electronics but didn't know where to start? Tired of low-quality kits with little to no instructions? <em>Project ReIgnite</em> is here to help!</p>
<p>Many beginner kits lack documentation, and their quality is questionable—often just cheap resells from AliExpress. Worse, they throw you straight into complex circuits with no guidance. That’s where <strong>Project ReIgnite</strong> comes in.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-project-reignite"><strong>What is Project ReIgnite?</strong><a href="https://wiki.projectrelabel.com/blog/reignite#what-is-project-reignite" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to what-is-project-reignite" title="Direct link to what-is-project-reignite">​</a></h2>
<p>We are designing a kit to take you from a complete beginner to someone confident in both <strong>SMD and through-hole soldering</strong>, while also learning the <strong>basics of electronics</strong>. Our structured, step-by-step approach ensures you learn valuable skills without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-it-works"><strong>How It Works</strong><a href="https://wiki.projectrelabel.com/blog/reignite#how-it-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to how-it-works" title="Direct link to how-it-works">​</a></h3>
<p>Our <em>ReIgnite Kit</em> consists of a <strong>staged set of linked boards</strong>, each introducing a new soldering method or electronics concept. By the end of the kit, you'll have completed multiple modules that not only teach you essential skills but also provide you with working circuits you can build upon!</p>

<p>We are currently testing the <strong>power board</strong>, the first module in the kit. Check out the render below:</p>
