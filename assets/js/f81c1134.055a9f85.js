Tired of low-quality kits with little to no instructions? *Project ReIgnite* is here to help!\\r\\n\\r\\nMany beginner kits lack documentation, and their quality is questionable\u2014often just cheap resells from AliExpress. Worse, they throw you straight into complex circuits with no guidance. That\u2019s where **Project ReIgnite** comes in.\\r\\n\\r\\n## **What is Project ReIgnite?**\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are designing a kit to take you from a complete beginner to someone confident in both **SMD and through-hole soldering**, while also learning the **basics of electronics**. Our structured, step-by-step approach ensures you learn valuable skills without feeling overwhelmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n### **How It Works**\\r\\n\\r\\nOur *ReIgnite Kit* consists of a **staged set of linked boards**, each introducing a new soldering method or electronics concept. By the end of the kit, you\'ll have completed multiple modules that not only teach you essential skills but also provide you with working circuits you can build upon!\\r\\n\\r\\n## **Current Progress**\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are currently testing the **power board**, the first module in the kit. Check out the render below:\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src=\'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectrelabel/projectrelabel.github.io/refs/heads/main/relabelwiki/static/img/powerboardpng.png\' alt=\'Power Board Render\' />\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the project progresses, we\u2019ll be sharing updates and sneak peeks of upcoming modules. Stay tuned!\\r\\n\\r\\n## **Get Involved!**\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\u2019re excited to share our journey with you. Follow us for updates and be among the first to experience *Project ReIgnite*!"}]}}')}}]);
