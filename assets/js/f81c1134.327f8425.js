While there are some great learning PCBs out there, they can lack documentation and the quality is not guaranteed, as most are cheap resells from aliexpress. You may also find that they are too much of a leap into the deep end of electronics; thats where Project ReIgnite comes in. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe are designing a kit to bring you from total beginner in the field to being confident in both SMD and through hole soldering, and the basics of electronics. These skills are very valuable, give yourself the best chance by starting your journey with the best kit!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Kit Overview\\r\\n\\r\\nOur ReIgnite kit will be a staged set of linked boards, each involving either a different soldering method or electrical concept. Build your way through the kit and you will have a set of modules, showing you key concepts that will give you the knowledge to make your own circuit!\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, the power board is being tested, see the 3D render below.\\r\\n<img src=\'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectrelabel/projectrelabel.github.io/refs/heads/main/relabelwiki/static/img/powerboardpng.png\'></img>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e"}]}}')}}]);
